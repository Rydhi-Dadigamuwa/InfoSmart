# InforSmart App

## Introduction

I have developed a simple GUI application designed to handle summarization and question-answering tasks. This application leverages advanced natural language processing models to provide concise summaries of texts and to answer questions based on the input data. It offers an intuitive interface that makes these powerful functionalities accessible to users without requiring them to have a deep understanding of the underlying technologies.

## Recommendations
1. Run on PyCharm:<br/>
It is recommended to run the application on PyCharm. PyCharm provides an excellent integrated development environment (IDE) for Python, offering features such as code completion, debugging, and package management that can greatly enhance your development experience.
2. Install PyTorch Before run the program<br/>

   ```
   pip install pytorch

## Note
At the first run the required models will download to your computer. It will take a little bit of time.
